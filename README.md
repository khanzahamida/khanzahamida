### about me — where i find beauty in every detail�

hi everyone! welcome to my little github corner 🌿
this is a place to store tasks, not to copy tasks

let’s get to know me, so let me introduce myself: i’m khanza hamida, the second child of three siblings. i’m still a high school freshman, currently diving into software engineering. i’d say i’m a cheerful person, enjoy meeting new people, and like hanging out with anyone.

one little fact about me: my favorite color is blue 💙
i’m captivated by it — the sky at its most serene, the ocean at its most breathtaking. there’s something magical about how blue makes the world feel calm, infinite, and full of possibilities. no wonder it’s my color of choice!

i fell in love with coding not through complex algorithms, but through my deep appreciation for design. i quickly realized that beautiful things don’t just happen; they’re crafted with logic and a touch of creativity.
now, i’m diving headfirst into the world behind the screen, exploring codes, debugging endless errors. i’m a proud beginner, eager to learn, and excited to transform my screen into something more alive each day.

### 🌟 Fun Facts & My Coding Quirks! ✨

Let's get a little personal! Here are some things that make my coding journey uniquely *mine*:

* **Design First!** 🎨 My love for coding sparked from appreciating programmers who care about *how things look*. Aesthetics are key!
* **The Green Light Feeling!** 🥳 There's nothing quite like the rush when that stubborn red error finally turns green. It feels like I've saved the whole world! 🦸‍♀️
* **My Debugging Strategy! 🤔 If a bug overstays its welcome, I might get a little frustrated, then run to AI (or my real boyfriend who always backs me up 🫣) for help. Teamwork makes the dream work!
* **Pastel Power!** 🩵 If it's soft, calm, and pastel blue, it has my heart. My coding environment often reflects this!
* **Curiosity Explorer!** 🔭 If something looks complicated, my brain immediately goes, "How does that *work*?!" I just have to know!

### 💻 My Little Projects: Where Code Meets Creativity 🌷

Here are some of the creations I'm proud of – each taught me something new, often through a lot of trial and error (mostly error 😅)!

* **[Data Mahasiswa](https://github.com/khanzahamida/Data-Mahasiswa.git)** (with `C++`)<br>
    The C++ project that pushed me to my limits, but I conquered it! 💪 It’s a simple student data management system.

* **[OISHI HOUSE](https://github.com/khanzahamida/OISHI-HOUSE.git)** (with `Python`)<br>
    A sweet little Python project that's as delightful as its name. Think "delicious" and "code"! 🍰
