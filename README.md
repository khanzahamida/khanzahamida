### 💖 About Me: Where Logic Meets Aesthetic 🎨

Hi, I'm Khanza, a student enchanted by the magic of coding! My journey began not with complex algorithms, but with a deep appreciation for **design** ✨. I quickly realized that beautiful things don't just happen; they're crafted with logic *and* a touch of creativity.

Now, I'm diving headfirst into the fascinating world behind the screen, exploring codes, debugging endless errors (and occasionally screaming a little 😭). I'm a proud beginner, eager to learn and transform my screen into something more alive each day.

| My Current Focus 📚 | My Dreams & Aspirations 🌟 |
| :------------------ | :------------------------- |
| Building solid basics with **C++** & **Python** | Venturing into **Web Development** 🌐 |
| Understanding database with **MySQL** | Exploring the wonders of **Data Analysis** 📊 |

### 🌟 Fun Facts & My Coding Quirks! ✨

Let's get a little personal! Here are some things that make my coding journey uniquely *mine*:

* **Design First!** 🎨 My love for coding sparked from appreciating programmers who care about *how things look*. Aesthetics are key!
* **The Green Light Feeling!** 🥳 There's nothing quite like the rush when that stubborn red error finally turns green. It feels like I've saved the whole world! 🦸‍♀️
* **My Debugging Strategy!** 🤔 If a bug overstays its welcome, I might rage a *tiny* bit before running to **AI** (or my amazing boyfriend 🫣) for help. Teamwork makes the dream work!
* **Pastel Power!** 🩵 If it's soft, calm, and pastel blue, it has my heart. My coding environment often reflects this!
* **Curiosity Explorer!** 🔭 If something looks complicated, my brain immediately goes, "How does that *work*?!" I just have to know!

### 💻 My Little Projects: Where Code Meets Creativity 🌷

Here are some of the creations I'm proud of – each taught me something new, often through a lot of trial and error (mostly error 😅)!

* **[Data Mahasiswa](https://github.com/khanzahamida/Data-Mahasiswa.git)** (with `C++`)<br>
    The C++ project that pushed me to my limits, but I conquered it! 💪 It’s a simple student data management system.

* **[OISHI HOUSE](https://github.com/khanzahamida/OISHI-HOUSE.git)** (with `Python`)<br>
    A sweet little Python project that's as delightful as its name. Think "delicious" and "code"! 🍰
