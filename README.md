### 💌 about me

i’m a student who fell in love with coding — not because of numbers, but because of how beautiful things can look when logic meets design ✨  
i started from **design**, but then i got curious about what happens *behind the screen*. now i’m exploring codes, bugs, and all the “why doesn’t this work??” moments 😭  

i’m still a beginner, but i love learning, experimenting, and making my screen a little more alive each day.  
currently learning the basics with **c++**, **python**, and trying to sneak into **web dev** and **data analysis** world (still halfway there but we moveee 😤).

### 🌸 fun facts about me 💭  

- i started liking coding because of *designs* — i just love when programmers care about how things look ✨  
- i get way too excited when the red error turns green... it feels like saving the whole world 😭  
- but if it stays red for too long, i’ll probably rage a little before running to ai (or my boyfriend 🫣) for help  
- i’m a beginner, but i love learning new things — from c++ to python, from web dev dreams to data analysis curiosity  
- python is my comfort zone. simple, clean, and honestly… kinda cute 🐍  
- sometimes i spend hours fixing one tiny bug, then celebrate like i just finished a huge project 😭  
- i like things that look soft and calm — pastel blue is my world 🩵  
- oh, and i get curious *about everything.* if something looks complicated, i *have* to know how it works.
